These individuals seek exciting and memorable experiences that challenge their limits and allow them to connect with nature. They are professionals or students passionate about adventure and travel, and expect to find detailed information on the website about available rafting tours, including difficulty level, duration, and highlights of each tour. Additionally, they want to know about safety precautions, provided equipment, and the booking process. Their main need is for a user-friendly platform that provides clear and concise information about rafting tours, ensuring safety and suitability for their skill level. They will primarily access the site through desktop, although access from mobile  should also be optimized.</p>
