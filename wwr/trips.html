            For the ultimate thrill-seekers, an extreme adventure that pushes
            the limits awaits. Experience the sheer intensity of skydiving from
            15,000 feet, freefalling at speeds of over 120 miles per hour before
            the parachute opens and you glide safely to the ground. This
            heart-pounding activity is the epitome of extreme sports, requiring
            nerves of steel and a sense of daring. The sense of accomplishment
            and exhilaration you’ll feel upon landing is unparalleled, making it
            the adventure of a lifetime for those brave enough to take the leap.
